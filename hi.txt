Hi
Firstly, I hope you are coming to this page only after finishing the other sections of this site and I hope you enjoyed it. This entire idea of doing a website came up in my head after that call we had few days after Adhavan's birthday in which you asked me "Ennaku laam yaaravdhu indha maari website pannuvaangala Jaswanth?". I know you really didn't make it sound serious or feel bad that unnaku yaarume apdi laam panna maataanga nu. But idk, it hit me hard and something after that made me realise and think why couldn't I myself do it. But I didn't want it to be a chumma simple one page-site maari. I wanted it to look pleasing and resemble an actual wholsome-ic site. So I drafted a rough idea in my head after which I approached my Vidhu cudie to ask if its possible. And that's when this whole thing started. (sorry if the whole site was too long)

Another honest reason for doing this thing is guilt.üëçLike I mentioned in our Pondy Bazaar outing, I really feel guilty for not celebrating your b'day on a large scale like we did for other people last year. And I genuinely feel its my fault because eppome I only initiate stuff for birthdays and last year I didn't do it for your b'day. Ennaku honesta appo unnoda avlo closeness feel aala so I left it to Madu, Shreya, Bhavana and Ananya to lead stuff. I'm not trying to fake here but over the last 4-5 month when we actually became proper closey-closey, there have been so many times when I genuinely felt so bad and guilty for this last year b'day sodhapal.

Ok coming to matter now.
HAPPY BIRTHDAY.
Before going in depth, I just feel grateful to this guy below for making us closer unintentionally.
